# Todo App

Hello,
This project made for [Popupsmart React Practicum](https://www.patika.dev/bootcamp/popupsmart-react-practicum). I use create-react-app.

### These are the what they want from us for complete the challenge:

- We want to get username from user and store it in localstorage. You can show the username anywhere on the page.
- We want all CRUD operations to take place on Todos. (Adding, deleting, editing, listing todos). You must perform all operations through the API you created.
- When adding a new todo, the input field should not be empty, it should contain at least 3 characters.
- You can perform asynchronous operations with Promise, .then or async/await.
  - BONUS => Dark Mode : You can add dark mode to your application by storing the user's dark mode preference in localestorage.

I completed all of them even with bonus.
I use 'axios' package for fetching data from [MockAPI](https://mockapi.io/).
It's my first time to use GET, PUT and DELETE operations with API. I learn a lot while doing this challenge.

You can check my deploy from right side of the page under the 'About' section.
